 When the article is a survey or a journal paper with less space constraints this section normally has 3 sub parts:

(a) what is the landscape? -> summaries and comparison table
What is the landscape? is close to what you currently have in this section. You can reinforce the comparison between the different existing works by compiling a list of criteria to compare them and then (a) introduce that list of criteria upfront to provide a lense or a frame of reference for the comparisons and (b) conclude your section with a comparison table using these criteria to give an overview and a commenting text summarizing the state of the art and identifying the open questions and among them the ones you are going to address.

(b) What are the trends? -> historical view and timeline
Is a question often overlooked in papers but which is very important too: while the landscape gives a overview of the topics it does not discuss the historical evolutions and temporality of the previous contributions. It is useful to give that information too, to identify the different trends and schools and to position you work in terms of continuation or break point w.r.t. the trends.
A “related work” section must not only list what exists, it must also say what is missing and what you are going to address i.e. it must also position your contribution in the big picture you are providing.

(c) where you contribution will be in the landscape (add your line to the table) and in the trends (position your work in the timeline w.r.t. to its heritage)


how a) and b) can be visual in the GUI?
