# Methods

SciLex is a Python‑based tool designed to search, retrieve, and analyze scientific papers using a structured, object‑oriented approach. The primary class, PaperRetriever, serves as the central interface and can be used both via the command line and as an importable module for integration into custom Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. Supporting classes—PubMedSearcher, ImageExtractor, PaperTracker, and ReferenceRetriever—extend its capabilities, allowing for enhanced paper searching, citation tracking, and figure extraction.


### Object-Oriented Structure
