"""
Adaptive rate limiter registry for SciLEx API collectors.

Solves two problems:
1. Per-instance _last_call_time resets to 0 on every new query, leaving
   a gap of zero wait between consecutive queries for the same API.
   The registry is process-wide (singleton), so all collector instances
   of the same API share a single timer — inter-query delays are enforced.

2. Fixed rate limits don't respond to throttle signals. When an API returns
   persistent 429s, extra_delay doubles (10s → 20s → 40s … ≤ 300s). After
   every SUCCESS_DECAY_INTERVAL successful requests the extra delay halves,
   so the limiter self-heals once the API cools down.
