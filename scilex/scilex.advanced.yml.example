# SciLEx Advanced Configuration (Optional)
# ============================================================================
#
# This file is OPTIONAL and only needed for power users and advanced workflows.
# Most users should NOT create this file - the system uses sensible defaults.
#
# How to use:
#   1. Copy this file to 'scilex.advanced.yml' in your project root
#   2. Uncomment and customize only the settings you need
#   3. The system will merge advanced settings with main scilex.config.yml
#
# Note: Settings in this file OVERRIDE the defaults in scilex.config.yml
#
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# SEMANTIC SCHOLAR API MODE
# ============================================================================
#
# NOTE: This setting is now CORE and should be in scilex.config.yml
# (moved from advanced to main config due to its importance for collection speed)
#
# If you want to override the setting from scilex.config.yml, uncomment below:
#
# Which Semantic Scholar endpoint to use:
#   - "regular" (DEFAULT): 100 papers per page, 1 req/sec, works with free tier
#   - "bulk": 1000 papers per page (10x faster), 1 req/sec, requires approval
#
# Example: Use bulk mode for faster collection (requires API approval)
#
# semantic_scholar_mode: bulk

# ============================================================================
# COLLECTION WORKFLOW CONTROL
# ============================================================================
#
# Advanced workflow settings for special cases
#
# collect:
#   Uncomment to skip collection phase and only aggregate existing data
#   Useful when re-aggregating with different quality filters
#
# collect: false

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM RELEVANCE SCORING WEIGHTS
# ============================================================================
#
# Override default relevance component weights (advanced tuning)
#
# By default, content relevance (45%) is prioritized over citations (10%)
# to avoid bias against recent papers.
#
# Example 1: Prioritize citations (citation-heavy research)
# quality_filters:
#   relevance_weights:
#     keywords: 0.35    # Content relevance
#     quality: 0.20     # Metadata completeness
#     itemtype: 0.15    # Publication venue
#     citations: 0.30   # Research impact (increased)
#
# Example 2: Strict quality focus (high standards)
# quality_filters:
#   relevance_weights:
#     keywords: 0.40
#     quality: 0.40     # Metadata completeness (doubled)
#     itemtype: 0.15
#     citations: 0.05

# ============================================================================
# ITEMTYPE BYPASS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Fast-track validation bypass for trusted publication types
# Papers with these types skip quality filters (performance optimization)
#
# Example: Bypass journals and conferences (most common case)
# quality_filters:
#   enable_itemtype_bypass: true
#   bypass_item_types:
#     - journalArticle
#     - conferencePaper

# ============================================================================
# ABSTRACT QUALITY VALIDATION
# ============================================================================
#
# Advanced abstract quality checking (detect truncation, boilerplate, encoding issues)
#
# Example: Enable abstract quality validation and filtering
# quality_filters:
#   validate_abstracts: true              # Validate and filter poor abstracts
#   min_abstract_quality_score: 60        # 0-100 scale (default: 60)

# ============================================================================
# OPEN ACCESS FILTERING
# ============================================================================
#
# Restrict collection to open access papers only
# WARNING: This significantly reduces collection size (typically 40-50% reduction)
#
# Example: Only open access papers
# quality_filters:
#   require_open_access: true

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM ITEMTYPE RELEVANCE WEIGHTS
# ============================================================================
#
# Override which itemTypes count as high-quality scholarly publications
# (Advanced tuning, rarely needed)
#
# Example: Different venue quality preferences
# quality_filters:
#   itemtype_relevance_weights:
#     journalArticle: true     # Peer-reviewed journals (10 points)
#     conferencePaper: true    # Conferences (10 points)
#     bookSection: true        # Book chapters (10 points)
#     book: true               # Books (10 points)
#     preprint: false          # Don't count preprints
#     thesis: false            # Don't count theses
