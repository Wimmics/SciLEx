# SciLEx Main Configuration File - Template
# ============================================================================
# Copy this file to 'scilex.config.yml' and customize for your research project
# Each collection run uses these parameters to search academic databases

# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# AGGREGATION SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Apply text filters during aggregation (filters papers based on abstract content)
# Set to 'true' to enable filtering, 'false' to keep all collected papers
aggregate_txt_filter: true

# Automatically fetch citation data for collected papers after aggregation
# Uses OpenCitations API to build citation networks
# Set to 'true' to get citations, 'false' to skip (faster but less complete)
aggregate_get_citations: true

# Output filename for aggregated results (relative to output_dir/collect_name/)
# The aggregated CSV will be saved as: output_dir/collect_name/aggregate_file
aggregate_file: '/aggregated_results.csv'

# ============================================================================
# QUALITY FILTERS
# ============================================================================

# Configure quality thresholds for filtering collected papers
# These filters are applied during aggregation to ensure data quality
quality_filters:
  # Require papers to have a DOI (improves citation tracking and prevents duplicates)
  # Google Scholar often lacks DOIs - set to false if using primarily GScholar
  require_doi: false

  # Require papers to have an abstract
  # Set to true for thorough literature reviews, false for bibliometric studies
  require_abstract: true

  # Minimum abstract length in words (detects truncated or stub abstracts)
  # Typical values: 50-100 words. Set to 0 to disable.
  min_abstract_words: 50

  # Maximum abstract length in words (detects copy-paste errors or non-abstracts)
  # Typical values: 500-1000 words. Set to 0 to disable.
  max_abstract_words: 1000

  # Require publication year to be present
  # Essential for temporal analysis and citation tracking
  require_year: true

  # Minimum number of authors (detects incomplete records)
  # Set to 0 to disable, 1 for at least one author
  min_author_count: 1

  # Generate quality validation report during aggregation
  # Reports show: papers filtered, reasons for filtering, data completeness stats
  generate_quality_report: true

  # === Phase 2 Features (Advanced Quality Control) ===

  # Validate abstract quality (detect truncation, boilerplate, encoding issues)
  # Set to true to get detailed abstract quality reports
  validate_abstracts: false

  # Minimum abstract quality score (0-100) if validate_abstracts is true
  # Papers below this score are flagged but not removed unless filter_by_abstract_quality is true
  min_abstract_quality_score: 50

  # Filter out papers with poor abstract quality
  # Only applies if validate_abstracts is true
  filter_by_abstract_quality: false

  # === Phase 3 Features (Citation-Based Filtering) ===

  # Apply time-aware citation filtering (requires aggregate_get_citations: true)
  # Filters papers based on citation count relative to their age:
  # - 0-3 months: 0 citations required (grace period for new papers)
  # - 3-6 months: 1+ citations
  # - 6-12 months: 3+ citations
  # - 12-24 months: 5-8+ citations (gradual increase)
  # - 24+ months: 10+ citations (established papers should have impact)
  # Recommended: true (focuses on impactful papers while keeping recent work)
  apply_citation_filter: true

  # Use Semantic Scholar citation data as fallback for OpenCitations
  # When OpenCitations returns 0 or no data, use citation counts from Semantic Scholar API
  # Helps with recent papers and preprints where OpenCitations has poor coverage
  # Only applies to papers collected from Semantic Scholar API
  # Recommended: true (significantly improves citation data completeness)
  use_semantic_scholar_citations: true

  # === Phase 4 Features (Relevance Ranking) ===

  # Apply composite relevance scoring to rank papers by importance
  # Combines: keyword frequency (3x), citations (2x), quality score (1x), journal bonus (0.5)
  # Papers are sorted by relevance score (higher = more relevant)
  # Recommended: true (helps prioritize most relevant papers)
  apply_relevance_ranking: true

  # Maximum number of papers to keep after all filtering (optional)
  # Set to a number (e.g., 500, 1000) to keep only top N most relevant papers
  # Set to null or remove to keep all papers that pass filters
  # Recommended: 500-1000 for focused reviews, null for comprehensive studies
  max_papers: 1000

  # Track which APIs found which papers and analyze overlap
  # Generates reports showing API value, overlap, and optimization recommendations
  # Recommended: true (helps optimize future API selection)
  track_duplicate_sources: true

# ============================================================================
# API SELECTION
# ============================================================================

# List of APIs to query for papers
# Available options:
#   - SemanticScholar: Best for AI/CS papers, excellent metadata, citations (API key optional)
#   - OpenAlex: Comprehensive open database, all disciplines, free
#   - IEEE: Engineering/tech papers (requires API key)
#   - Elsevier: Broad coverage via ScienceDirect (requires API key + institutional token)
#   - Springer: Scientific papers (requires API key)
#   - HAL: French open archive, multidisciplinary, free
#   - DBLP: Computer science bibliography, free
#   - Arxiv: Preprints, mostly physics/CS/math, free
#   - GoogleScholar: Broadest coverage but slower (free, uses web scraping)
apis:
  - SemanticScholar
  - OpenAlex
  - GoogleScholar
  - IEEE

# ============================================================================
# API-SPECIFIC SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Semantic Scholar API endpoint mode
# Controls which Semantic Scholar endpoint to use for searches
# Options:
#   - "regular" (default):
#     * Uses standard search endpoint: /paper/search
#     * Works with standard API keys
#     * More reliable, better for most use cases
#     * Lower rate limits but sufficient for typical research
#     * 100 papers/query limitation (through pagination)
#   - "bulk":
#     * Uses bulk search endpoint: /paper/search/bulk
#     * Designed for large-scale data retrieval 
#     * Requires higher-tier API access or special approval
#     * 1000 papers/query limitation 
#     * Apply at: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api#api-key-form
#
#
semantic_scholar_mode: regular

# ============================================================================
# COLLECTION CONTROL
# ============================================================================

# Enable/disable the collection phase
# Set to 'true' to run collection, 'false' to skip (useful when only aggregating existing data)
collect: true

# Name for this collection run
# Creates a timestamped directory: output_dir/collect_name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
# Use descriptive names like: 'rag_survey', 'knowledge_graphs_2024', 'llm_agents'
collect_name: my_research_project

# Email address (optional, used by some APIs for rate limit increases)
# Some APIs like Arxiv give better rate limits with a valid email
email: your.email@example.com

# Maximum number of articles to collect per query per API
# Set to a positive number (e.g., 500, 1000, 2000) to limit articles per query
# Set to -1 for unlimited (collect all available papers)
# Recommended: 1000 (balanced), 500 (faster), 2000 (comprehensive)
# Impact: With 126 queries (6×7×3) and 5 APIs, max_articles=1000 yields ~630,000 papers total
# Note: This ensures consistent collection sizes across APIs regardless of their page sizes
max_articles_per_query: 1000

# ============================================================================
# SEARCH KEYWORDS
# ============================================================================

# Keywords for paper search - supports two modes:
#
# MODE 1: Single keyword group (papers matching ANY keyword)
# keywords:
#   - ["machine learning", "deep learning", "neural networks"]
#
# MODE 2: Two keyword groups (papers matching ANY from group 1 AND ANY from group 2)
# This creates a Cartesian product: (keyword1_group1 AND keyword2_group2) OR ...
# Example below searches for papers about RAG/LLMs AND knowledge graphs
keywords:
  - ["RAG", "Retrieval Augmented Generation", "LLM", "Large Language Model", "GPT"]
  - ["Knowledge Graph", "knowledge graphs", "semantic network", "ontology"]

# Note: Keywords are case-insensitive on most APIs
# Use variations and synonyms for better coverage
# For single-concept searches, just use one group:
# keywords:
#   - ["quantum computing", "quantum computer", "qubits"]
#   - []  # Empty second group

# ============================================================================
# OUTPUT DIRECTORY
# ============================================================================

# Base directory for all output files
# Results will be saved in: output_dir/collect_name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
# Each API creates its own subdirectory: SemanticScholar/, IEEE/, etc.
output_dir: output

# ============================================================================
# YEAR RANGE
# ============================================================================

# List of years to search
# Creates separate queries for each year (allows resuming if interrupted)
# For range 2020-2024, list: [2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]
# Or for recent papers only: [2023, 2024, 2025]
